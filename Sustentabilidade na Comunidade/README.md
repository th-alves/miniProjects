# Recipe Application

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Utilize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build a dynamic recipe application. You'll have the chance to practice working with a third-party API, bringing your project to life with a variety of recipes.

This project presents a fantastic opportunity to work with a frontend JavaScript framework like Vue or React. However, feel free to use any tools or technologies you're comfortable with to complete the project. If there's something you're eager to practice or explore, go ahead and give it a try

2. Ensure responsiveness by creating layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop, following the provided design.
3. Integrate data from the [third party API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/recipes) to populate the application with recipes.
